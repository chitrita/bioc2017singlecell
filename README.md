# BioC 2017 workshop
## Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data: Normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and lineage inference
__Fanny Perraudeau (@fperraudeau) Davide Risso (@drisso), and Kelly Street (@kstreet13)__

This repository contains the code and data needed for the workshop.

The workshop is divided into five main parts:

1. Pre-processing: [scone](https://github.com/YosefLab/scone)
2. Normalization and dimensionality reduction: [zinbwave] (https://github.com/drisso/zinbwave)
3. Cell clustering: [clusterExperiment](https://github.com/epurdom/clusterExperiment)
4. Cell lineage and pseudotime inference: [slingshot](https://github.com/kstreet13/slingshot)
5. Differential expression analysis along lineages
